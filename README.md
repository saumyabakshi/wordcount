# Word Count Program

## Description
My own `wc` implementation in Go. It supports the following flags:
- `-l`: print the number of lines in the input file
- `-w`: print the number of words in the input file
- `-c`: print the number of bytes in the input file
- `-m`: print the number of characters in the input file

## Usage
```bash
./wordCount [flag] [files]
```
or 
```bash
cat [file] | ./wordCount [flag]
```
